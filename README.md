# Simple GitHub Message App

This project is a simple sample project that was originally developed for the pre-test for a company I applied to in the past. No third party libraries were allowed as part of the requirements for the project.

The app uses the GitHub users API to simulate a messaging app (no actual messages are sent).

One improvement that I would like to make is to add cancellation support to the image caching system.
